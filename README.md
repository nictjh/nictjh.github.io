# My Initial Coding Project
## Resume Created with HTML and CSS

I've created a basic resume using HTML and CSS. This project was primarily an exercise in learning the basics. The website itself is quite simple and straightforward, focusing solely on presenting information. While it might seem "low level," it's an important step in my journey of understanding the fundamentals.
**Please excuse this less than satisfactory work**
